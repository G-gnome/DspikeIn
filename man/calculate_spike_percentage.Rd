\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A phyloseq object containing the microbial data.}

\item{merged_spiked_species}{A character vector of spiked species to check in the phyloseq object. Default is NULL.}

\item{merged_spiked_hashcodes}{A character vector of spiked hashcodes to check in the phyloseq object. Default is NULL.}

\item{output_path}{A character string specifying the path to save the output files. Default is NULL, which saves the report as "merged_data.docx".}

\item{passed_range}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range of percentages to categorize results as "passed". Default is c(0.1, 11).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the percentage of spiked taxa reads and the pass/fail results.

A data frame containing the percentage of spiked taxa reads and the pass/fail results.
}
\description{
This function calculates the percentage of reads from specified spiked species or hashcodes in a phyloseq object.
It merges the spiked taxa into one ASV, calculates the percentage of reads, categorizes the results as passed or failed,
and saves the results as a DOCX and CSV file.
